# Project - Memes ðŸš€

This project was created as a practical exercise for my course, following the professor's instructions. It's a first look into handling JSON data from a public API. The application fetches memes from an external source and displays them on a user-friendly interface built with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. [Site Example](https://github.com/bootcampfullstack/bootcamp-devjr-modulo6-memes/blob/main/Memes.png).
